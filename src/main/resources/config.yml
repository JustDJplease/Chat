formats:

  # The format for the global chat
  # With this, you can do two things:
  # 1. Global chat formats
  # With this, everyone will have the same chat format
  # Example: chat: 'chat' (default)
  # 2. Per-group chat formats
  # With this, you can specify separate chat formats for separate Vault permission groups.
  # Example:
  # chat:
  #   default: 'chat'
  #   owner: 'chat-owner'
  chat: 'chat'

  # The format for private messages from the senders POV
  private-sender: 'privatesender'

  # The format for private messages from the receivers POV
  private-receiver: 'privatereceiver'

  # The format for join messages
  # With this, you can also get global and per-group formats
  # For explanation, see the command above formats.chat
  join: 'join'

  # The format for leave messages
  # With this, you can also get global and per-group formats
  # For explanation, see the command above formats.chat
  leave: 'leave'

# If a join or quit format has been set to 'none', should it print out nothing (if true),
# or let it be handled by another plugin/do nothing/print out default message? (if false)
